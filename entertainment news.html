						<h4>Kanye West calls out Drake, Tyson, Nick Cannon over ‘negative’ comments on Kim Kardashian </h4>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Kanye-West.jpg" alt="" /></span>Popular American rapper, Kanye West has called our Drake Nick Cannon and Tyson Beckford over an alleged negative statement made about his wife, Kim Kardashian.


Kanye West in videos on his Instagram page warned the trio to stop saying negative things about Kim Kardashian henceforth.

Speaking on his issues with Nick Cannon, he said:” I’m out of the sunken place, I can be Ye and express how I feel, there’s a couple of things that I want to address. First of all, I wanna address Nick Cannon. I understand that you used to date my wife, but [when] you get in an interview, don’t mention my wife. If someone brings up my wife, you say, ‘Ye, I respect that man. I’m not speaking on that.'”

</p>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/download%20(1).jpg"  alt="" /></span>West addressing Drake said, “If I wasn’t in a medicated state, I would have had the wherewithal to say, ‘Hey Pusha, don’t diss Drake on my beat and I spoke about that and took accountability for that.
“The fact that people are making rumours that you fucked my wife and you not saying nothing and you carrying it like that, that doesn’t sit well with my spirit.”
He also stated how he believes Drake’s usage of “Kiki” from his single “In My Feelings” was directed at his wife.
“You know, if I had a girlfriend from Chicago and her name was Ranita and then you was married to Rihanna, I wouldn’t make no song called ‘Riri.’ So when you’re like, ‘Oh, I don’t know where it come from, you’re too smart for that, bro. You know where that come from. Don’t make no record with nothing that can be confused.”
Lastly, West switched his comments at model Tyson Beckford,saying “As far as Tyson Beckford goes, don’t speak on my wife, bro. None of you all should speak on my wife.

“Nick Cannon, Drake, Tyson Beckford all that negativity does not sit right with me, that’s why I had to address it like this.”</p>
